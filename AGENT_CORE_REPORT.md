# AGENT_CORE_REPORT — Canonical 1:1 Emission Model Audit

**Agent:** AGENT-CORE
**Branch:** `claude/inspiring-cannon-509jt4`
**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Task:** Audit ArosCoin emission logic against the canonical model; correct deviations; add explicit `calculate()` function.

`src/token/` does not exist — there is no legacy `token/` module. The production
emission logic lives entirely in `src/emission/`, `src/aroscoin/`, `src/commission/`,
and `src/reserve/`.

Module `01_coin_engine/` is documentation only, not deprecated code. No executable
content resides there.

## 2. Canonical Model (as verified against specs)

```
Emission     = Transaction Amount                              (1:1)
Commission C = Transaction Amount × feeRate                    (default 0.5%)
  Node Share = C × 0.75                                       (75% → nodes, post-factum by PoT weight)
  AFC Share  = C × 0.25                                       (25% → Reserve AFC, recorded in NodeChain)

ARO lifecycle per confirmed process:
  MINT(amount)  ← PoT verified === 1
  … process executes …
  BURN(amount)  ← cycle completion; net = 0

Reserve:
  reserveIndex   = log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)              ← spec formula, confirmed volume only
  internalPrice  = base × reserveIndex                        ← rises as confirmed work accumulates
  AFC accruals   → NodeChain (audit trail), not in formula
```

Sources of authority (highest first): `docs/specs/AST_Reserve_AGENT_EN.md`,
`reference/ast-core/src/reserve.ts`. Both agree on the formula.

## 3. Conformant — No Changes Needed

| Component | Canonical Requirement | Verdict |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| `EmissionService.emit()` | Mint = amount (1:1), PoT-gated | ✓ Correct |
| `EmissionService.mint()` | Throws if `verified !== 1` | ✓ Correct |
| `EmissionService.burn()` | Burns exactly `minted`; process net → 0 | ✓ Correct |
| `ArosCoinService` three-tally ledger | `totalSupply = (processMinted − processBurned) + earnedRetained` | ✓ Correct |
| `CommissionService.feeRate` | 0.005 (0.5%) | ✓ Correct |
| `CommissionService.marginRate` | 0.25 (25% → AFC) | ✓ Correct |
| Commission 75/25 distribution | 75% to nodes via `coin.recordEarned`, 25% via `reserve.addAfcAccrual` | ✓ Correct |
| Commission pool reconciliation | `paid + margin == total` per epoch | ✓ Correct (I7) |
| PoT gate | Idempotent verify; binary verdict; gates all downstream value | ✓ Correct (I1/I2) |
| NodeChain | Append-only, hash-continuous | ✓ Correct (I8) |
| Nodes | Work+reputation weight; no stake/slashing fields | ✓ Correct (I9) |
| All-Seeing Eye | Passive: observe, log, signal; no state mutations | ✓ Correct (I10) |

## 4. Deviation Found and Corrected

### 4.1 ReserveService — `reserveIndex()` Formula

**File:** `src/reserve/reserve.service.ts`

**Spec authority:** `docs/specs/AST_Reserve_AGENT_EN.md`:
```yaml
formulas:
  reserveIndex: "reserveIndex = log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)"
```

**Reference authority:** `reference/ast-core/src/reserve.ts`:
```typescript
reserveIndex(): number { return log10(1 + this.totalProcessVolume); }
```

Both the highest-authority spec and the reference are unambiguous: the formula uses
`totalProcessVolume` only.

| | Before (deviated) | After (spec-correct) |
|--|------|------|
| Formula | `log10(1 + totalProcessVolume + totalAfcReserve)` | `log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)` |
| AFC input | Included in index computation | Recorded in NodeChain only (audit) |

**Root cause:** A previous agent added `totalAfcReserve` to the formula to implement
"AFC Reserve grows → price rises". This is correct in intent — the price does rise as
confirmed work accumulates — but the mechanism is already present through
`totalProcessVolume`, which grows with every verified process. Including `totalAfcReserve`
additionally contradicts spec I-RS-1 ("grows only from confirmed volume") because AFC
accruals are commission derivatives, not direct confirmed process volume.

**What stays unchanged:** `addAfcAccrual()` still records the AFC event in NodeChain
(correct per I3 — every significant event recorded). `totalAfcReserve()` still reads that
history for querying. The event routing from Commission is correct and untouched.

## 5. Invariant Impact After Change

| ID | Rule | Impact |
|----|------|--------|
| I1 | Value only on verified === 1 | Unaffected — emission gate untouched |
| I2 | Every emission bound to confirmed process | Unaffected |
| I3 | All significant events in NodeChain | AFC accrual still recorded → compliant |
| I4 | Deterministic: same input → same result | `reserveIndex` still deterministic from NodeChain |
| I5 | Process part nets to 0 | Unaffected |
| I6 | `totalSupply = earnedRetained` after burns | Unaffected — AFC not in coin ledger |
| I7 | Pool reconciles: `paid + margin == fees` | Unaffected |
| I8 | NodeChain append-only | Unaffected |
| I9 | Node influence from work+reputation | Unaffected |
| I10 | Eye passive: no state change | Unaffected |
| I-RS-1 | Grows only from confirmed volume | Now correct — formula uses only process volume |
| I-RS-2 | Derivable from NodeChain | Still holds — recomputed from history each call |
| I-RS-4 | Monotonic non-decreasing | Still holds — log(1 + volume) is monotonic |

## 6. Transaction Example: $10,000

```
TX Amount     = 10,000 ARO
Emission      = 10,000 ARO   ← MINT (1:1, PoT-gated)
Commission    = 10,000 × 0.005 = 50 ARO
  Node Share  = 50 × 0.75 = 37.50 ARO  → coin.recordEarned (post-factum, epoch finalization)
  AFC Reserve = 50 × 0.25 = 12.50 ARO  → reserve.addAfcAccrual → NodeChain event (audit)
Burn          = 10,000 ARO   ← BURN (net circulating change = 0)

reserveIndex (after process):     log10(1 + 10_000) ≈ 4.0000
internalPrice = base × 4.0000    → rises with each additional confirmed process
```

## 7. Files Changed

### Previous session (`claude/inspiring-cannon-4m9xnj`, 2026-06-18)
```
src/reserve/reserve.service.ts    reserveIndex() formula corrected:
                                  log10(1 + totalProcessVolume + totalAfcReserve)
                                  → log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)   [spec I-RS-1/I-RS-2]
```

### This session (`claude/inspiring-cannon-509jt4`, 2026-06-20)
```
src/emission/emission.service.ts  Added EmissionCalculation interface, constants, and
                                  calculate(txAmount, rate?) — pure 1:1 formula function.
                                  emit() now calls calculate() to derive emission amount.

src/emission/emission.service.spec.ts
                                  Added 8 new tests covering calculate() formula:
                                  1:1 ratio, commission, 75/25 split, custom rate, zero,
                                  determinism, and emit→calculate integration.

10_proof_of_transaction_engine/pot_tx_incentive_distribution.md
                                  Fixed stale paths:
                                  src/token/emission.service.ts → src/emission/emission.service.ts
                                  src/fee_distribution/fee_distribution.service.ts → src/commission/commission.service.ts
