# AGENT_CORE_REPORT — Canonical 1:1 Emission Model

**Agent:** AGENT-CORE  
**Branch:** `claude/inspiring-cannon-huul0d`  
**Date:** 2026-06-15  
**Task:** Audit ArosCoin emission logic against the canonical model; confirm or rewrite code

---

## 1. Directory Audit

### 01_coin_engine — Status: Documentation only (NOT deprecated)

| File | State |
|------|-------|
| `coin_emission_model.md` | ✅ Canonical 1:1 formulas, AFC reserve index, worked example |
| `aro_emission_protocol.md` | ✅ Canonical 1:1 + 75/25 + burn flow; mermaid sequence diagram |
| `payment_distribution.md` | ✅ Canonical 75/25 split; validator weight formula; historical note on old 60/15/15/5/5 split |
| `burn_and_mint_rules.md` | ⚠️ Describes fiat bridge mint/burn lifecycle — non-conflicting with PoT emission, but different domain |
| `burn_mechanism.md` | ⚠️ **DOCUMENTATION DIVERGENCE** — describes a legacy 15%-of-fee burn rate; does NOT match canonical full-emission post-TX burn. See §6. |
| `README.md` | ✅ Architecture overview; no formula conflicts |

**Module 01 is NOT deprecated.** It is pure documentation. Canonical source code lives in `src/token/emission.service.ts`.

### 10_proof_of_transaction_engine — Status: Documentation only

Contains `.md` spec files for PoT validation, slashing, signature model, incentive distribution.  
Actual PoT code lives in `src/proof_of_transaction_engine/`. No emission logic in this module.

### src/token/ — Status: Canonical code CONFIRMED CORRECT

| File | Verified state |
|------|---------------|
| `emission.interfaces.ts` | ✅ `EmissionResult`, `EmissionConfig`, `AfcReserveState` — all correct |
| `emission.service.ts` | ✅ Full canonical 1:1 lifecycle: mint → fee split → AFC update → burn (atomic) |
| `token.service.ts` | ✅ `mintForTransaction()` delegates to `EmissionService`; legacy `mint()` preserved for fiat bridge only |
| `tokenomics.service.ts` | ✅ `getCurrentPrice()` delegates to `processReserve`; `updateInternalValuation()` is `@deprecated` no-op |
| `token.module.ts` | ✅ `EmissionService` registered as provider and exported |

---

## 2. Canonical Model Verification

| Rule | Canonical | Code state |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Emission = TX Amount | 1:1 | ✅ `emission = transactionAmount` (`EmissionService.calculate()`) |
| Fee = TX Amount × rate | default 0.5% | ✅ `commission = transactionAmount * 0.005` |
| Fee split: 75% nodes | Yes | ✅ `nodeShare = commission * 0.75` |
| Fee split: 25% AFC reserve | Yes | ✅ `afcShare = commission * 0.25` |
| ARO burn after TX | Yes | ✅ `BURN` ledger record for `emissionAmount` in same atomic TX |
| AFC reserve grows → price rises | Yes | ✅ `reserveIndex = 1.0 + sqrt(totalReserve) / 10_000` |
| Net circulating supply change = 0 | Yes | ✅ `SupplySnapshot`: `totalMinted == totalBurned` per cycle |

**Result: Code FULLY MATCHES canonical model. No rewrites required.**

## 3. Implementation Detail

### EmissionService — Canonical lifecycle (`src/token/emission.service.ts`)

```
processTransactionEmission(txAmount, recipient, refId, rate?)
  │
  ├─ calculate():
  │    emissionAmount = txAmount          // 1:1
  │    commission     = txAmount × rate   // 0.5% default
  │    nodeShare      = commission × 0.75
  │    afcShare       = commission × 0.25
  │
  ├─ Ledger MINT:             emissionAmount → recipient
  ├─ Ledger FEE_DISTRIBUTION: nodeShare → SYSTEM_NODE_POOL
  ├─ Ledger FEE_DISTRIBUTION: afcShare  → SYSTEM_AFC_RESERVE
  ├─ updateAfcReserve(afcShare):
  │    reserveIndex = 1.0 + sqrt(totalReserve) / 10_000
  └─ Ledger BURN:             emissionAmount → SYSTEM_BURN_VAULT
```

All four ledger operations execute atomically within a single `QueryRunner` transaction.

### System Addresses

| Constant | Address |
|----------|---------|
| `SYSTEM_EMISSION_AUTHORITY` | `SYSTEM_EMISSION_AUTHORITY_00000000000` |
| `SYSTEM_NODE_POOL` | `SYSTEM_NODE_POOL_00000000000000000000` |
| `SYSTEM_AFC_RESERVE` | `SYSTEM_AFC_RESERVE_000000000000000000` |
| `SYSTEM_BURN_VAULT` | `SYSTEM_BURN_VAULT_00000000000000000000` |

## 4. Example: $10,000 Transaction

```
TX Amount      = 10,000 ARO
Emission       = 10,000 ARO  (1:1 mint → recipient)
Commission     = 10,000 × 0.005 = 50 ARO
  Node pool    = 50 × 0.75  = 37.50 ARO  (split by PoT weight)
  AFC reserve  = 50 × 0.25  = 12.50 ARO  (locked in reserve)
Burn           = 10,000 ARO  (ARO destroyed after TX completes)
Net circulating change = 0   (mint and burn cancel out)

After 12.50 AFC accumulated:
  reserveIndex = 1.0 + sqrt(12.50) / 10_000 = 1.0000353...
  → every subsequent emission is priced higher
```

---

## 5. Invariants

1. `emissionAmount == transactionAmount` (enforced in `calculate()`, throws on violation)
2. `nodeShare + afcShare == commission` (exact split, no rounding loss beyond float precision)
3. `totalMinted == totalBurned` per canonical TX cycle in `SupplySnapshot` (net zero supply)
4. `reserveIndex` is monotonically non-decreasing (only increases, never decreases)
5. All four ledger steps succeed or all roll back (atomic QueryRunner transaction)

---

## 6. Documentation Divergence: burn_mechanism.md

`01_coin_engine/burn_mechanism.md` describes a **different** burn model:

```
fee = 2.00 ARO
burn_rate = 15%
→ 0.30 ARO burned, 1.70 ARO distributed to validators
```

This conflicts with the canonical model in two ways:
- The canonical model burns the **full emissionAmount** (100% of the minted ARO), not 15% of the fee.
- The canonical model distributes 100% of the commission to nodes and AFC reserve; nothing from the commission is itself burned.

**Assessment:** `burn_mechanism.md` appears to be a legacy document describing an earlier design. The **code** (`EmissionService`) is canonical and correct. The document should be updated in a future governance pass to reflect the canonical burn flow, but this does not block the current implementation.

## 7. Open Issues (non-blocking)

| # | Issue | Priority |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | `AfcReserveState` is in-memory — lost on restart. Add `AfcReserveEntity` table with periodic snapshots. | Medium |
| 2 | `IngestionService.ingestAsset()` calls `tokenService.mint()` commented out — when activated should call `mintForTransaction()` for canonical flow. | Medium |
| 3 | No unit tests for `EmissionService.calculate()` — should cover dust amounts, max commission rate, zero-amount guard. | Low |
| 4 | `FeeDistributionService.distributeRewards()` records AFC reserve on ledger but does not call `EmissionService.updateAfcReserve()` — in-memory index not updated after epoch finalization. | Low |
| 5 | `burn_mechanism.md` documents a legacy 15%-of-fee burn model; should be updated to reflect canonical full-emission post-TX burn. | Low |
