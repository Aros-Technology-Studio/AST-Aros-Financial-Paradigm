`src/token/` does not exist — there is no legacy `token/` module. The production
emission logic lives entirely in `src/emission/`, `src/aroscoin/`, `src/commission/`,
and `src/reserve/`.

`01_coin_engine/` and `10_proof_of_transaction_engine/` are documentation only,
not deprecated code. No executable content resides in either folder.

## 2. Canonical Model (as verified against specs)

```
Emission     = Transaction Amount                              (1:1)
Commission C = Transaction Amount × feeRate                    (default 0.5%)
  Node Share = C × 0.75                                       (75% -> nodes, post-factum by PoT weight)
  AFC Share  = C × 0.25                                       (25% -> Reserve AFC, recorded in NodeChain)

ARO lifecycle per confirmed process:
  MINT(amount)  <- PoT verified === 1
  ... process executes ...
  BURN(amount)  <- cycle completion; net = 0

Reserve:
  reserveIndex   = log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)              <- spec I-RS-1/I-RS-2; confirmed volume only
  internalPrice  = base x reserveIndex                        <- rises as confirmed work accumulates
  AFC accruals   -> NodeChain (audit trail), not in formula
```

Sources of authority (highest first): `docs/specs/AST_Reserve_AGENT_EN.md`,
`docs/specs/AST_Emission_AGENT_EN.md`, `docs/specs/AST_Commission_AGENT_EN.md`,
`reference/ast-core/src/`.

## 3. Full Conformance — No Code Changes Required

All emission, ledger, commission, and reserve logic is canonical. The single
historical deviation (`reserveIndex()` including `totalAfcReserve`) was corrected in
PR #306 (`claude/inspiring-cannon-4m9xnj`, commit `dad29bd`). This run confirms
that correction is in place and all other components pass.

| Component | Canonical Requirement | File | Verdict |
|-----------|----------------------|------|---------|
| `EmissionService.emit()` | Mint = amount (1:1), PoT-gated | `src/emission/emission.service.ts:55` | Correct |
| `EmissionService.mint()` | Throws if `verified !== 1` | `src/emission/emission.service.ts:71` | Correct |
| `EmissionService.burn()` | Burns exactly `minted`; process net -> 0 | `src/emission/emission.service.ts:85` | Correct |
| `ArosCoinService` three-tally ledger | `totalSupply = (processMinted - processBurned) + earnedRetained` | `src/aroscoin/aroscoin.service.ts:86` | Correct |
| `CommissionService.feeRate` | 0.005 (0.5%) | `src/commission/commission.service.ts:69` | Correct |
| `CommissionService.marginRate` | 0.25 (25% -> AFC) | `src/commission/commission.service.ts:72` | Correct |
| Commission 75/25 distribution | 75% to nodes via `coin.recordEarned`, 25% via `reserve.addAfcAccrual` | `src/commission/commission.service.ts:148-159` | Correct |
| Commission pool reconciliation | `paid + margin == total` per epoch (I7) | `src/commission/commission.service.ts:172` | Correct |
| `ReserveService.reserveIndex()` | `log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)` — spec I-RS-1/I-RS-2 | `src/reserve/reserve.service.ts:92` | Correct |
| AFC accrual routing | `addAfcAccrual()` records to NodeChain; not in index formula | `src/reserve/reserve.service.ts:81` | Correct |
| PoT gate | Binary verdict; gates all downstream value | `src/pot/pot.service.ts` | Correct (I1/I2) |
| NodeChain | Append-only, hash-continuous | `src/nodechain/nodechain.service.ts` | Correct (I8) |
| Nodes | Work+reputation weight; no stake/slashing fields | `src/nodes/nodes.service.ts` | Correct (I9) |
| All-Seeing Eye | Passive: observe, log, signal; no state mutations | `src/all-seeing-eye/all-seeing-eye.service.ts` | Correct (I10) |
| Orchestrator burn ordering | mint → commission.accrue → burn (reference canonical order) | `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.service.ts` | **Fixed this run** |
| `coin_emission_model.md` code path | `src/emission/emission.service.ts` | `01_coin_engine/coin_emission_model.md` | **Fixed this run** |
| `coin_emission_model.md` reserveIndex | `log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)` | `01_coin_engine/coin_emission_model.md` | **Fixed this run** |

## 4. Deviations Corrected This Run

### 4.1 Orchestrator: Burn Ordering (`src/orchestrator/orchestrator.service.ts`)

The orchestrator previously called `emission.emit()` which bundles mint + burn atomically,
then called commission accrual. This inverted the reference canonical order: burn happened
before commission, where the reference burns after.

**Reference canonical order** (`reference/ast-core/src/orchestrator.ts` lines 57–68):
```
mint(amount) → commission.accrue(fee) → reserve.addConfirmedVolume → burn(amount)
```

**Before:** `emission.emit()` → commission.accrue (burn already done inside emit)

**After:** `emission.mint()` → commission.accrue → `emission.burn()` (canonical order)

Economic outcome is identical (processNet → 0 either way). Both `mint()` and `burn()` already
existed as public methods on `EmissionService`; no new API was added.

### 4.2 Documentation: `01_coin_engine/coin_emission_model.md`

**Error 1 — wrong code path** (Model-A remnant):
```
Before: src/token/emission.service.ts   (never existed)
After:  src/emission/emission.service.ts
```

**Error 2 — wrong reserveIndex formula** (from a different model variant):
```
Before: reserveIndex = 1.0 + sqrt(totalAfcReserve) / 10_000
After:  reserveIndex = log10(1 + totalProcessVolume)
```
The agent spec (`docs/specs/AST_Reserve_AGENT_EN.md`) and reference both define the log10 formula.

**Error 3 — wrong API methods** (referenced non-existent methods):
Updated to reflect the actual `EmissionService` API and the canonical 3-step lifecycle order.

## 5. Transaction Example: $10,000

```
TX Amount     = 10,000 ARO
Emission      = 10,000 ARO   <- MINT (1:1, PoT-gated; verified === 1)
Commission    = 10,000 x 0.005 = 50 ARO
  Node Share  = 50 x 0.75 = 37.50 ARO  -> coin.recordEarned (post-factum, epoch finalization)
  AFC Reserve = 50 x 0.25 = 12.50 ARO  -> reserve.addAfcAccrual -> NodeChain event (audit trail)
Burn          = 10,000 ARO   <- BURN (net circulating change = 0)

reserveIndex (after process):     log10(1 + 10_000) = 4.0000
internalPrice = base x 4.0000    -> rises monotonically with each confirmed process (I-RS-4)
```

## 5. Invariant Coverage

| ID | Rule | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| I1 | Value only on PoT verified === 1 | `EmissionService.emit()` gate |
| I2 | Every emission bound to a confirmed process | `EmissionService.mint()` throws on unverified |
| I3 | All significant events in NodeChain | Full lifecycle events appended |
| I4 | Deterministic: same input -> same result | Sorted node iteration; log formula |
| I5 | Process part nets to 0 (`processNet -> 0`) | burn(minted) called after commission accrual |
| I6 | `totalSupply = earnedRetained` after burns | Tally identity holds |
| I7 | Pool reconciles: `paid + margin == fees` | Epsilon check in `finalizeEpoch()` |
| I8 | NodeChain append-only, hash-continuous | `reconstruct()` breaks on tamper |
| I9 | Node influence from work+reputation | No stake fields; weight = reputation x uptime |
| I10 | Eye passive: no state change | `compareSupply`/`verifyChain` read-only |
| I-EM-1 | Causality: every mint bound to verified process | Confirmed |
| I-EM-2 | PoT gate: no mint without verified === 1 | Confirmed |
| I-EM-3 | Cycle symmetry: process part burned on completion | Confirmed |
| I-RS-1 | Grows only from confirmed volume | `reserveIndex` uses `totalProcessVolume` only |
| I-RS-2 | `reserveIndex` derivable from NodeChain, not set manually | Recomputed from history each call |
| I-RS-4 | Monotonic non-decreasing | `log10(1 + volume)` is monotonic |

## 6. Prohibition Grep Results

No prohibited construct found in production code (`src/`):

| ID | Forbidden Pattern | Result |
|----|-------------------|--------|
| P1 | `staking / stakedBalance / stake_freeze` | Clean |
| P2 | `slashing against balance` | Clean |
| P3 | `token-weighted governance` | Clean |
| P4 | `farming / passive yield` | Clean |
| P5 | `mint-on-deposit / crypto_to_aroscoin` | Clean |
| P6 | Eye halting/reverting/voting | Clean |
| P7 | Emission outside confirmed-process logic | Clean |

## 7. Files Changed

```
src/orchestrator/orchestrator.service.ts   Burn ordering: emit() → separate mint + commission + burn
01_coin_engine/coin_emission_model.md      reserveIndex formula + code path + API corrected
AGENT_CORE_REPORT.md                       Updated with this run's findings (supersedes previous run)
```
